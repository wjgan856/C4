C4

A program version of the game Connect 4.

If you are not familiar with the game, go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four

This game is meant two people, but you can play against yourself.

When you move your mouse across the board, an indicator will appear, representing where you can place disc.

Just click to place it there.



If there are any bugs, problems, or suggestions, tell me under issues.
